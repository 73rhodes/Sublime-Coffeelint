Sublime-Coffeelint
----------------

Currently for Mac / Linux.

Install coffeelint: `npm install -g coffeelint`

You should have `/usr/local/bin/node` and /usr/local/bin/coffeelint`

Copy the files to `~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages/Coffeelint`

Set the build system to coffeelint. Tools > Build System > coffeelint

This runs `coffeelint` when you save a `.coffee` file and prints the output to the console.

Super simple for now.
