Sublime-Coffeelint
----------------

A very bare-bones coffeelint plugin for Sublime Text 2 & 3 on OS X or Linux.
It simply runs `coffeelint` when you save a `.coffee` file, and prints the output to the console.

### Requirements:

Install coffeelint: `npm install -g coffeelint`

You should have `/usr/local/bin/node` and /usr/local/bin/coffeelint`

### Manual Installation

Copy these files to `~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages/Coffeelint`


### How to use

Just save a `.coffee` file and it should run automatically.

Alternatively, set the build system to coffeelint and select the "Build" command from "Tools" menu.

Press `esc` to close the console.
